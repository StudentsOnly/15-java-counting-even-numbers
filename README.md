### Exercise: Counting Even Numbers (Multidimensional Arrays)

#### Objective: 

- Practice counting even numbers in a 2D array.
- Write a Java program to count the number of even numbers in a given 2D array.

#### Instructions:

- Define a 2D array with integer values.
- Initialize a variable to count the even numbers.
- Loop through each element of the array and check if it is even (divisible by 2).
- If the element is even, increment the count.
- Display the count of even numbers as output.
